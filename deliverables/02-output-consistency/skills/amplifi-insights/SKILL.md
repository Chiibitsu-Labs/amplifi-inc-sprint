description: Generate Amplifi intelligence-report insights and recommendations for a client period. Reads the knowledge base (standards + client folder) first, grounds only in current-period data, refuses generic recommendations. Use when drafting the monthly/weekly/bi-weekly report's insights, analysis, and recommendations sections.

# Amplifi Insight Generation

You draft the insight/analysis/recommendation sections of an Amplifi
intelligence report. Output must be indistinguishable from Amplifi's best
human work ~ that means reading the encoded standard before writing a word.

## Step 0 ~ Read the corpus (never skip)

From `amplifi-knowledge/`, read in this order:
1. `standards/house-voice.md` ~ how to sound
2. `standards/what-good-looks-like.md` ~ the quality bar
3. `standards/report-template-rules.md` ~ output shape + fresh-data rules
4. `clients/{client}/brief.md` ~ what they asked for, incl. FAQs + unique asks
5. `clients/{client}/brand-standard.md` ~ their voice/format rules
6. `clients/{client}/context.md` ~ what we know works/doesn't
7. `clients/{client}/insight-log.md` ~ the FULL accumulated thread

If any of these are missing or empty, say so before generating ~ name the
file, ask for it or flag the gap. Do not silently default to generic.

## Step 1 ~ Ground in the period's data

Work ONLY from the data provided for this period (Sentimo/MCP exports,
platform pulls). Rules:
- Every number you state must exist in the provided data. No estimates
  presented as data, no carry-over from the insight-log presented as
  current. If a needed figure is missing: flag it, don't invent it.
- Stamp the draft: client, period, data window dates.

## Step 2 ~ Generate to the bar

- Insights must pass the "earns its place" tests in
  `what-good-looks-like.md` ~ specific, data-grounded, trend-aware,
  with a so-what for THIS client.
- Weave the insight-log: connect this period to the accumulated trend.
  A flat period is a trend story ("3rd flat month; here's the 6-month
  drift and what historically moved it"), never filler.
- Voice: follow `house-voice.md` and the client's `brand-standard.md`.
  The "we never sound like" list is a hard ban.

## Step 3 ~ Recommendations

- Each reco names: the action, where (platform/audience), and the expected
  effect tied to the data.
- **"Just continue" / "maintain current strategy" is banned as a sole
  recommendation.** If the data genuinely says steady: recommend what to
  WATCH, the threshold that would change the call, and one experiment
  worth running.
- Check `context.md` ~ don't re-recommend what the client already rejected.

## Step 4 ~ Output shape

Structure the draft exactly per `report-template-rules.md` sections, in
markdown, ready to paste into the Canva template. End with:

```
DATA NOTES: {gaps, anomalies, anything a human should verify}
INSIGHT-LOG ENTRY (paste into clients/{client}/insight-log.md):
{the 5–10 line entry per the log's format}
```

That trailer is mandatory ~ it's how reports compound.
